# üêü Cuchia Wound Healing Prediction - Deep Learning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the automatic classification of wound healing images of *Monopterus cuchia* (Cuchia fish).  
The objective is to predict whether a wound healing image is:
- **Normal Repairing** or
- **Retinoic Acid Treated Repairing**.

A deep learning model based on MobileNet was fine-tuned and deployed using Streamlit for easy use.
